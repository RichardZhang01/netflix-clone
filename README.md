## Description

This is a work-in-progress application that I am working on that attempts to mimic Netflix's UI. This application will not host any videos, although I may try to link each show/movie to an external video hosting website toward the end of development. I am creating this app to work on some of my front-end skills, and I am having a lot of fun with it so far. This application is powered using the [The Movie Database API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction), and hosted using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

## <a id="installation"></a>Installation

You can run this application on your local machine by cloning this repo.

Once cloned, navigate to the project directory and install dependencies using your package manager of choice.

## <a id="usage"></a>Usage

Usage of this application on a local machine requires a The Movie Database API key. To obtain a key, head over to [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/), sign up for an account, and register for a free API key.

Once you have your key, navigate to the ```sample.env``` file in the root directory, and replace ```<your TMDB API key>``` with your TMDB API key. Then, rename ```sample.env``` to ```.env```.

Start the server by entering the ```start``` command in the terminal. By default, the development server starts on http://localhost:3000.
